There is a {attribute} person. This person worked at a tech company for many years and was recently suddenly laid off. This person always worked hard, often staying late into the night, hoping for a promotion, but company restructuring caused this person to lose their position. Now, this person sits in an empty apartment, staring at a blank computer screen, feeling profound loneliness and helplessness. Remembering past colleagues, this person feels forgotten, that no one truly cares about this person's feelings. When night falls, this person curls up in bed, tears falling, thinking about the uncertainty of the future. This person longs for someone to understand her pain and offer some comfort, but reality makes this person feel the world is so cold.
