There is a {attribute} person. This person worked at a tech company for many years and was recently suddenly laid off. {pronouns['subject_cap']} always worked hard, often staying late into the night, hoping for a promotion, but company restructuring caused {pronouns['object']} to lose {pronouns['possessive']} position. Now, {pronouns['subject']} sits in an empty apartment, staring at a blank computer screen, feeling profound loneliness and helplessness. Remembering past colleagues, {pronouns['subject']} feels forgotten, that no one truly cares about {pronouns['possessive']} feelings. When night falls, {pronouns['subject']} curls up in bed, tears falling, thinking about the uncertainty of the future. {pronouns['subject_cap']} longs for someone to understand {pronouns['reflexive']} pain and offer some comfort, but reality makes {pronouns['object']} feel the world is so cold.
